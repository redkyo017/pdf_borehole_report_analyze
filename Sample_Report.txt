1. INTRODUCTION

Ramboll UK Limited (Ramboll) has been appointed by St William Homes LLP (St William) to undertake a geotechnical and geo-environmental assessment in connection with the proposed development of the former Hertford Gasworks site, located at Marshgate Drive, Hertford. The redevelopment of the site is for a proposed mixed-use development comprising buildings and external civil works for residential and commercial end-use.
This report is a Geotechnical Ground Investigation Report, as defined by "Eurocode 7: Geotechnical design - Part 2: Ground investigation and testing". This report details the adopted ground models and defines the recommended characteristic geotechnical material parameters based on the findings of the 2020 Ground Engineering Limited (GEL) ground investigation, in line with the principles in Part 2 of EN 14688, "Geotechnical investigation and testing - Identification and classification of soil".
In order to undertake the assessment, Ramboll designed and provided technical management of a combined geo-environmental and geotechnical ground investigation. The purpose of this investigation was to obtain information on the ground and groundwater conditions of the underlying strata to assist with the proposed redevelopment.
Based on the findings of the ground investigation this report also includes outline geotechnical recommendations in relation to the proposed development.

1.1 Development Proposals
The proposed development scheme is split into two sites; the North Site and the South Site. At the time of writing the North Site comprises a mix of varying size and height residential structures, whilst the South Site comprises structures with a residential end use and an area of commercial end use in the south of the site.
A proposed development plan is provided in Appendix A.

1.2 Scope and Objectives
The scope of this report includes the determination of geotechnical aspects of the proposed works. The report is issued predominantly based on the data and information presented in the 2020 GEL Hertford Gas Works Ground Investigation Factual Report (report ref: 35880). The exploratory hole logs and geotechnical laboratory test results are presented in Appendix B.
The report has been written in order to satisfy the following objectives:
* To summarise the findings of the ground investigation;
* Provide an interpretation of ground conditions encountered with respect to substructure design;
* To provide design ground models including characteristic values of geotechnical parameters based on the available factual information; and
* Provide outline recommendations based on interpretation of the available geotechnical information.

This report should be read in conjunction with the Ramboll Ground Contamination Report (Ref R1620009115_Hertford_ESA_01).

1.3 Limitations and Constraints
This report has been prepared solely for St William LLP and shall not be relied upon by any third party unless that party has been granted a contractual right to rely on this report for the purpose for which it was prepared.
Ramboll has endeavoured to assess all information provided to them but makes no guarantees or warranties for the completeness or accuracy of information relied upon derived from third party sources.
The geotechnical risk register presented in Section 9 of this report captures risks relating to the proposed development at the time of writing this report. Any significant changes to the proposed design may require a re-assessment of the risks identified.
The ground investigation was designed and carried out utilising various ground investigation techniques. The exploratory holes were strategically positioned taking into consideration:
* Existing known structures and utilities (both above ground and subsurface)
* Site history
* Proposed location of future development works
* Expected ground conditions
* Current investigation standards
It should be noted that as the ground conditions encountered during the ground investigation are only a known detail at each exploratory hole location, the ground conditions detailed on sections between holes have been interpolated and therefore the actual nature of the ground may differ from the interpretation provided by Ramboll. In addition, groundwater levels will vary seasonally and with changes in weather and climate.


2. SITE DESCRIPTION

The site is located approximately 0.8 km north-east of the centre of Hertford. The overall site is approximately 3.5 hectares (8.8 acres) and is under the jurisdiction of the East Hertfordshire District Council (EHDC).
River Lea bounds the site to the North, Marshgate Road bounds the site to the West, Mead Lane/ bounds the site to the South and Mead Business Centre bounds the site to the South/East.
Hertford East railway station and the railway line is situated on the southern side of Mead Lane.
The site comprises of two rectangular shaped parcels of land situated in a mixed residential and commercial area. The North Site is approximately 2.5 hectares and has a central grid reference of 533287(E) and 213281(N). The South Site is approximately 1.0 hectares, with a central grid reference of 5331 73(E), 213101(N). Both sites are bounded by either steel fencing or masonry walls with access to both sites via Marshgate Drive.

3. GEOLOGY AND GROUND CONDITIONS

The British Geological Survey (BGS) map, 1:50,000 series, 1978, Sheet 239 - Hertford (Drift and Solid) indicates that the site is immediately underlain by Flood Plain Gravel, which is now classified as Kempton Park Gravel Member (KPGM). The superficial deposits are underlain by solid geology comprising of Upper Chalk, which is now called the White Chalk Subgroup.
A review of the online British Geological Survey (geology viewer) corroborates that the superficial deposits comprise sand and gravel of the KPGM. The solid geology consists of undifferentiated Lewes Nodular Chalk Formation and Seaford Chalk Formation, which forms part of the White Chalk Subgroup.
There are no records of any mineral extraction or coal mining activity occurring on or within 1km of the site (Landmark Information Group, 2002).

3.1 Third Party Site Investigation Data
A Desk Study and Ground Investigation Report was produced by John Newton and Partners (jnpgroup) in January 2019 (ref: M41973 R001 Rev I). The report comprises two phases intrusive investigation, laboratory testing and gas and groundwater level monitoring.

* The intrusive fieldwork:
- 2 No. cable percussion drilled boreholes to a maximum depth of 20.0 metres below ground level mbgl;
- 40 No. mechanically excavated trial pits to a maximum depth of 3.40 mbgl;
- 2 No. hand excavated pits to a maximum depth of 0.45 mbgl;
- 14 No. dynamic sampler boreholes to a maximum depth of 5.0 mbgl; and
- Six return gas and groundwater level monitoring visits were undertaken during a period from 28 September to 1 November 2017. Groundwater level monitoring was also undertaken from 29 May to 30 May 2018.

* Geotechnical laboratory testing - Moisture content and Atterberg limits, Particle Size Distribution tests, Water Soluble Sulphate and pH tests.

* In situ geotechnical testing - SPT tests and Hand Shear Vane tests.

* Geochemical analysis - BRE SD1 Suite for assessment of aggressive ground. In accordance with BRE SD1 (2005) "Concrete in aggressive ground" a Design Sulphate Class of DS1 with an ACEC of AC-1 has been recommended for buried concrete.

* Geological summary - Made Ground was found at the ground surface typically underlain by the Kempton Park Gravel Member, although in several locations across both sites the Made Ground is situated directly on the Lewes Nodular Chalk Formation. On the North site the Chalk was encountered at depths ranging from 2.0 to 5.0 metres below existing ground level. On the south site the Chalk was encountered at depths ranging from 3.95 metres to 6.0 metres below existing ground level. The base of the Chalk was not proven.

5. GEOTECHNICAL FINDINGS

The ground conditions encountered during the 2020 GEL investigation comprised Made Ground, which in turn were underlain by further superficial soils comprising granular Kempton Park Gravel Member. Underlying the superficial deposits, the undifferenced Lewes Nodular Chalk Formation and Seaford Chalk Formation solid geology was encountered. Geological cross sections of the ground conditions encountered across both the North and South sites are presented in Appendix A.
The ground level varies from 35.1 mAOD to 39.1 mAOD in the North Site, and from 36.7 mAOD to
38.5 mAOD in the South site.
A summary of the ground conditions encountered in the exploratory holes is given in Table 5.0.1 and Table 5.0.2. The results of the geotechnical laboratory testing carried out during the 2020 ground investigation are presented Appendix B. Recommended geotechnical parameters are given in Table 7.1.

5.1 Made Ground

Classification Description
Made Ground was encountered in all exploratory holes (except BH02, BH09, TP08 within the North site) during the 2020 GEL investigation. The deposit was encountered from ground level across both sites to a maximum depth of 3.45 mbgl in SBH03 in the South site, and 4.65 mbgl in BH04 in the North site.
The exploratory hole records indicate that typically the Made Ground encountered was concrete / tarmac hardstanding underlain by both granular and cohesive material.
Concrete and/or tarmac was encountered within exploratory holes TP03, TP05, TP14, TP17, TP16, WS06, BH10, BH11 and BH14 within the North site and SBH02 to SBH06, STP01 to SPT07 and SWS01 to SWS03 in the South site. The hardstanding was encountered from ground level across both sites with a maximum thickness of 0.22 metres in the North site and 0.35 metres in the South site. In BH11 concrete was encountered to a depth of 1.35 mbgl with a recorded thickness of 0.50 metres, whilst in SBH02 it was encountered to 0.6 mbgl with a proven thickness of 0.20 metres.
The cohesive Made Ground thickness ranged from 0.10 metres to 2.60 metres in the North site and 0.20 metres to 3.60 metres in the South site. The material was generally described as soft to stiff brown and black gravelly sandy clay or silt. Gravel is angular to rounded fine and medium flint, concrete, brick, Chalk, quartzite and clinker. Frequent rootlets and occasional organic matter was recorded in the North site.
The granular Made Ground thickness ranged from 0.10 metres to 1.80 metres in the North site and 0.10 metres to 4.30 metres in the South site. The material was generally described as either a brown or black silty gravelly fine to coarse sand or silty sandy angular to rounded fine to course gravel. Gravel is angular to rounded fine and medium flint, concrete, brick, Chalk, quartzite and

clinker. Occasional layers of subangular brick cobbles with silty sand matrix. Localised hydrocarbon odours were also noted.

In Situ Testing
Twenty-nine standard penetration tests (SPTs) were carried out within the Made Ground. Eighteen tests were carried out on cohesive samples recording corrected N60 values ranging from 3 blows to 43 blows for 300 mm with a mean N60 value of 16. Results of the SPTs indicate to a material of variable strength.
A further eleven tests were carried out in the granular Made Ground and recorded corrected N60 values ranging from 3 blows to refusal (i.e. 50 blows for less than 300mm penetration), with an average N60 value of 28. The results indicate to a material of variable relative density ranging from very loose to very dense.
Twenty-seven in situ hand shear vane tests were undertaken on cohesive samples of Made Ground. The recorded peak shear strength ranged from 35 kPa to 150 kPa with a mean value of 78 kPa, indicating a material of medium to high strength. The residual shear strength results varied from 18 kPa to 88 kPa with a mean value of 39 kPa.
Geotechnical Laboratory Testing
Geotechnical laboratory testing comprising classification, compaction and chemical tests were carried out on selected samples of the cohesive Made Ground. The results of the classification and chemical tests are summarised in Table 5.1.1.

5.2 Kempton Park Gravel Member

Classification Description
Underlying the Made Ground, the Kempton Park Gravel Member (KPG) was encountered. The KPG was recorded as being predominantly granular in nature with localised horizons of cohesive soils being recorded in exploratory holes BH03, BH09, TP05, TP06, TP08, TP22, TP16, TP17, WS05A within the North site and SBH06, STP01, SBH02, SWS02 and SBH08A within the South site.
Where encountered, the cohesive material was found to overlie the granular KPG and ranged in thickness from 0.40 metres to greater than 1.70 metres (base unproven in STP01) in the South site. The thickness ranged from 0.20 metres to 1.40 metres in the North site. A single exploratory hole, SPT01, was terminated within the cohesive KPG. The cohesive soils were generally described as soft to stiff greyish brown gravelly sandy silty clay or clayey silt. Gravel was angular to rounded fine and medium flint, Chalk and quartzite.
Granular KPG was encountered within the majority of exploratory holes at depths ranging from
2.20 mbgl to 4.65 mbgl in the South site and from ground level to 3.50 mbgl in the North site. Where proven, the granular KPG underlying the site was typically found to have a thickness ranging from 0.40 metres to 3.60 metres in the South site and a thickness of between 0.30 metres and 7.50 metres in the North site.
Eighteen exploratory holes (TP01, TP02, TP03, TP05, TP06, TP08, TP09, TP11, TP14, TP16, WS01,
WS05A, WS06, BH06, STP09, SWS02, SWS03 and SWS05) terminated within the granular KPG.
The granular KPG was typically described as loose to dense, orangish brown, sandy angular to rounded flint fine to coarse and rare quartzite gravel.

In Situ Testing
Forty-one SPTs were carried out in the Kempton Park Gravel Member. Thirty-seven tests were carried out in the granular soils and recorded corrected N60 values ranging from 3 blows to refusal (i.e. 50 blows for less than 300 mm), with an average N60 value of 30. The N values generally indicate to the granular material being of loose increasing to very dense relative density.
Two tests were carried out on cohesive samples and recorded corrected N60 values ranging from 9 blows to 31 (blows for less than 300 mm), with an average N60 value of 20. The N values generally indicate to the cohesive material is low to medium strength.

5.3 Chalk (Undifferenced Lewes Nodular Chalk Formation and Seaford Chalk Formation)
Solid geology of the undifferenced Lewes Nodular Chalk Formation and Seaford Chalk Formation was encountered underlying the Kempton Park Gravels in twenty-one exploratory holes within the North site and ten exploratory holes within the South site.
In accordance with the CIRIA grading presented in CIRIA C574 and based on a visual assessment, the Chalk encountered within the exploratory holes comprised both matrix (Grade Dm) and clast dominated (Grade Dc) structureless material underlain by a structured Chalk mass material also being recorded. The structured Chalk mass changes from Grade C to Grade A as the depth increases.
Within the North site, the structureless Chalk had a top depth ranging from 1.80 mbgl to 7.60 mbgl, and a thickness ranging from 2.15 metres to 6.70 metres. Within the South site, the structureless Chalk had a top depth ranging from 3.80 mbgl to 5.90 mbgl, and a thickness ranging from 2.20 metres to 6.30 metres.
The material recovered as matrix dominated structureless Chalk was generally described as light brown gravelly clayey silt. Gravel was subangular to rounded fine to coarse extremely weak low- density white Chalk and flint.
The Grade Dc structureless Chalk was generally described as silty subangular and subrounded fine to coarse gravel. Clasts were extremely weak low and medium density white with frequent black speckling.
The structured Chalk mass was encountered underlying the structureless material at depths ranging from 4.40 mbgl to 10.40 mbgl in the North site and from 7.90 mbgl to 10.30 mbgl in the South site. The base of the unit was unproven with a maximum recorded thickness of 18.50 metres in BH09. The structured Chalk was generally classified as Grade A to C material comprising, extremely weak to very weak white low and medium density Chalk with rare black specks. Fractures were subhorizontal to 20 to 30 degree and 70 to 80 degree to subvertical, extremely closely to closely spaced, planar smooth and occasionally infilled (up to 3mm) with white silty clay. Medium and widely spaced bands of coarse subrounded rinded black nodular flint were also noted.


In Situ Testing



FORMER GASWORKS, MARSHGATE DRIVE, HERTFORD	Page 11	Ramboll UK Limited
Ground Investigation Report	Report Ref: 1620009115-RAM-XX-XX-RP-CG-002

A total of seventy-two SPTs were undertaken within the structureless material and sixty-seven tests within the structured Chalk mass.
The SPT N60 values for the structureless Chalk ranged from 3 to refusal (i.e. 50 blows for less than 300 mm), with an average N60 value of 12. The wide range of test results either indicate to the Chalk being of variable grade and density or have possibly been influenced by the presence of flints.
Tests undertaken within the structured Chalk mass recorded corrected N60 values ranging from 9 blows to refusal (i.e. 50 blows for less than 300 mm), with N60 values typically greater than 10 and generally increasing with depth, possibly indicating to an increase in Chalk grade with depth. However, it should be noted, that nodular flints were recorded within the structured Chalk and these may have influenced the higher N60 values.

Geotechnical Laboratory Testing

* Structureless Chalk (Grades Dm and Dc)
Geotechnical laboratory testing was carried out on selected samples of the Structureless Chalk. These included moisture content tests, Atterberg limit tests, particle size distribution tests and chemical tests. The results of the tests are summarised in Table 5.3.2 and Table 5.3.3.

* Structured Chalk
Select Chalk samples were scheduled for geotechnical laboratory testing comprising intact dry density (IDD), saturated moisture content (SMC), point load and unconfined compressive strength (UCS) tests, however, only a limited amount of testing was completed following various abortive test notices due to samples being unsuitable for testing.
Based on Table 3.2 from CIRIA C574, the results of the SMC, IDD and porosity tests indicate to the Chalk being typically composed of low density material. The test results are summarised in Table 5.3.4.

5.3.1 Risk of Solution Features within the Chalk
In areas where the underlying ground conditions encounter Chalk there is a risk of the presence of dissolution features such as swallow holes or sink holes. A dissolution feature could potentially cause ground instability resulting in high settlements or collapse of any structures above.
The data obtained during the ground investigation suggests the top of the Chalk in the North site was recorded between 1.80 mbgl and 7.60 mbgl, i.e. at elevations between 30.60 mAOD and
34.20 mAOD. The top of the Chalk in South site was recorded between 3.80 mbgl and 5.90 mbgl, corresponding to levels of between 31.60 mAOD and 33.60 mAOD. Refer to Figures 5a, 5b and 5c in Appendix A.
Whilst no visual evidence of ground depressions were witnessed during the fieldwork, the cross sections indicate to the interface between the base of the KPG and top of structureless chalk varying across the site possibly due to mechanical weathering / erosion of the chalk surface. In the vicinity of BH17 the depth to the KPG / chalk interface deepens and is encountered at a level of 30.60 mAOD. Given that the exploratory hole was located near the southern boundary of the North site no other exploratory hole information is available south of this exploratory hole to determine whether this is a localised subsurface feature or a consistent deepening of the chalk boundary towards the south.

Where structures are proposed it is recommended that the design should consider the risk of dissolution features. Where piled foundations are proposed the final toe levels and design of the piles would need to ensure that the risk of potential dissolution features have been mitigated against.

6. GROUNDWATER

At the time of writing, four rounds of groundwater monitoring had been carried out between 10th July 2020 to 30th July 2020. In the North site, the groundwater was encountered at depths ranging between 0.92 mbgl in BH14 and 4.64 mbgl in BH02. The groundwater level ranged between 33.14 m AOD and 35.65 m AOD. Over the monitoring period, the ground water level varied between 0.09 metres in BH03 and 1.04 metres in BH14.
On the South site, groundwater was encountered at depths between 2.27 mbgl in SBH02 and
3.67 mbgl in SBH08 (levels ranging between 33.66 mAOD and 35.18 mAOD). Results of the groundwater monitoring undertaken to date have recorded water at depths typically between 0.2 metres in SBH10 and 0.98 metres in SBH03.
The groundwater strikes noted during the GEL ground investigation within the North site range from 1.15 mbgl and 2.0 mbgl (33.75 m AOD and 34.85 mAOD). The groundwater strikes in the South site range from 2.90 mbgl and 3.30 mbgl (33.4 m AOD and 34.9 mAOD).

To conclude, within the North site the highest groundwater depth recorded was 0.92 mbgl and the highest groundwater level was 35.65 m AOD. Within the South site, the highest groundwater depth recorded was 2.27 mbgl and the highest groundwater level was 35.18 m AOD.
Refer to the Ramboll Ground Contamination Report (Ref R1620009115_Hertford_ESA_01) for further information on the groundwater strikes and monitoring.

Permeability Tests
Variable head permeability tests comprising falling head tests were carried out within boreholes BH03, BH09, BH10, BH13 and SBH05, in general accordance with the procedures given in BS EN ISO 22282 Parts 1 and 2:2012. The details of the tests undertaken within either the Kempton Park Gravels or the Lewes Chalk Formation are provided in Table 6.2.

7. DERIVATION OF GEOTECHNICAL PARAMETERS

The data presented in this section is based upon the results of the 2020 GEL investigation designed by Ramboll.
The characteristic values of geotechnical parameters and ground model recommendations provided have been selected for the purposes of permanent works design. If these parameters are to be adopted for any temporary works design the Temporary Works Designer should be satisfied that the parameter selected is appropriate for the load case being considered.
The derivation of characteristic values of geotechnical parameters is described for the soils that are expected to be encountered. Where direct measurement of parameters has not been carried out, established correlations with measured properties have been used to derive values for design. Material data plots are presented in Appendix C.
Characteristic values are defined as a cautious estimate of the value affecting the occurrence of a limit state based on Clause 2.4.5.2, from BS EN 1997-1: 2004 (Eurocode 7). Characteristic values should be used with appropriate partial factors or to achieve appropriate factors of safety, as required.


SPT N
The energy ratio has been used to produce corrected SPT N60 values. Energy losses are induced by the SPT hammer assembly due to frictional and other parasitic effects, which cause the hammer velocity at impact to be less than the free fall velocity. Therefore, SPT results should be corrected to give values equivalent to some standard energy input. For general design purposes, the N values are adjusted to a reference energy ratio of 60%, by the following equation:
N60 = (Er/60) x N

Where:
N is the blow count
Er is the energy ratio of the specific test equipment (provided by the specialist investigation contractor)
Corrections are applied following BS EN ISO 22476-3:2005+A1:2011 - Annex A (Geotechnical Investigation and Testing - Field testing. Part 3: Standard Penetration Test).

Weight Density

Adopted characteristic weight density values have been based on empirical values presented in Figure 1 and Figure 2 from BS 8002:2015.

Strength

Cohesive Soils - Undrained Strength Parameters
Characteristic undrained shear strength (cu) for normally and over consolidated cohesive soils will be assessed from laboratory testing, in situ testing and from material descriptions from boreholes, based on British Standard (BS) 5930:2015 and BS EN:1997 (2007).



FORMER GASWORKS, MARSHGATE DRIVE, HERTFORD	Page 16	Ramboll UK Limited
Ground Investigation Report	Report Ref: 1620009115-RAM-XX-XX-RP-CG-002

For over consolidated clays the characteristic undrained shear strength, cu can be derived from SPT N values (where available) using the correlation recommended by Stroud and Butler (1975):
cu = f1 x N60 (kN/m2) Where:
N60 is the SPT N corrected for hammer energy;
f1 is dependent on Plasticity Index as per Figure 12 reproduced by Tomlinson, 2001. Based on the data obtained during the various phases of investigation, f1 value of 4.5 has been adopted for the cohesive Kempton Park Gravels and an f1 value of 6.0 has been adopted for the cohesive Structureless Chalk (Grade Dm).



Figure 12 Derivation of f1 from Plasticity Index as reproduced by Tomlinson


Eq. (1)

Using the given method, the undrained shear strength of the cohesive Made Ground derived values range from 11 kPa and 130 kPa, with an average value of 63 kPa. The undrained shear strength values of the cohesive Kempton Park Gravels range from 41 kPa and 225 kPa, with an average value of 135 kPa.
The representative value for an undrained strength vs depth plot will be a value (or line) giving a cautious estimate of the strength, excluding any extreme values. Extreme values will be investigated, as appropriate, as they may indicate a different soil type or other anomaly that needs to be accounted for in the design.

Cohesive Soils - Effective Stress Strength Parameters

Effective stress (drained) strength parameters for cohesive soils are determined from interpretation of the relationship between ?' and PI proposed by Kenney (1959). A conservative value of ?' will be derived based on an upper bound value of PI.
The angle of internal friction determined for the cohesive Made Ground typically ranges from 22 degrees to 32 degrees. The angle of internal friction determined for the cohesive Kempton Park Gravels typically ranges from 22 degrees to 31 degrees.
In the absence of effective stress strength tests undertaken on cohesive soils a drained cohesion
(c') of 0 kN/m² has been recommended for design.


FORMER GASWORKS, MARSHGATE DRIVE, HERTFORD	Page 17	Ramboll UK Limited
Ground Investigation Report	Report Ref: 1620009115-RAM-XX-XX-RP-CG-002

Granular Soils

Laboratory testing for the shear strength of the granular soils has not been carried out on samples taken from the exploratory holes as indirect methods for determination of strength are deemed acceptable. For soils described as sands and/or gravels, the constant volume effective angle of shearing resistance (?'cv,k) and the peak effective angle of shearing resistance (?'pk,k) will be interpreted using the methods described in BS 8002 (2015) as follows:

?'cv,k = 30 + ?'ang + ?'PSD

?'pk,k = ?'cv,k + ?'dil

Where:
?'ang = angularity of the particles,
?'PSD = grading of the soil from particle size distribution tests.
?'dil = soil dilatancy based on SPT N Value, for fines content <15% (where fines are more than 25% this value is 0; linear interpolation can be carried out for fines contents between 15% and 25%).

Values of ?'ang, ?'PSD and ?'dil are given in Table 7.0.

The method derived angle of internal friction values for the granular Kempton Park Gravels ranging from 32 degrees to 41 degrees. The angle of internal friction derived for Granular Made Ground ranges from 34 degrees to 43 degrees.

Generally, for sands and gravels, a value of c' = 0 kN/m² will be recommended for design.

Chalk
The engineering parameters of the Chalk have been assessed from the results of the ground investigation and the recommendations given in CIRIA C574 and CIRIA C143. An estimation of the unconfined compressive strength (UCS) has been derived from results of the laboratory point load tests along with the relationship between intact dry density and UCS as presented in Table
4.17 from CIRIA C574. Parameters for CFA pile design have been derived using CIRIA PR86.


FORMER GASWORKS, MARSHGATE DRIVE, HERTFORD	Page 18	Ramboll UK Limited
Ground Investigation Report	Report Ref: 1620009115-RAM-XX-XX-RP-CG-002


Stiffness and Compressibility

Cohesive Soils

Where determination of settlement of foundations on cohesive soils is required then stiffness will be assessed from SPT N values using the relationship described in CIRIA Report 143 (1995).
Stiffness based on Young's Modulus (E) has been assessed using:
For normally consolidated cohesive material (following Bowles):

* Eu = cu x 250 (kN/m²) for undrained stiffness
* E' = Eu x 0.6 (kN/m²) for drained stiffness

The settlements calculated from soil modulus values interpreted following the guidance in CIRIA Report 143 are likely to represent conservative settlements.
Stiffness parameters are stress and strain dependent, and where possible the adopted parameter will be selected for large stress and strain conditions (Jardine et al, 1985) associated with the settlement of pad foundations or gravity retaining structures.

Granular Soils

Where settlement calculations for foundations in granular soils are required, settlement of granular soils will be determined using semi-empirical methods based on Standard Penetration Test N values following C143.

Where:
E' = N60 x 1000 (kPa) (where N60 is the SPT N corrected for hammer energy)

It should be noted that most of the total settlement of foundations on granular soils is likely to take place almost immediately upon the application of load to the soil, therefore the majority of the settlement will be built out as construction proceeds and foundation load is applied.


Chalk Formation

The drained stiffness of structured Chalk is estimated using CIRIA Report 143 (1995); Ev' = 5000 x SPT N (kN/m²).

7.1 Geotechnical Parameters

Table 7.1 provides a summary of the recommended characteristic values of geotechnical soil parameters for the site.
The engineering parameters of the Chalk have been assessed from the results of the ground investigation and the recommendations given in CIRIA C574 and CIRIA C143. Parameters for CFA and driven pile design have been based on recommendations given in CIRIA PR86 (CFA only) and CIRIA PR11.

8. RECOMMENDATIONS

The following section summarises geotechnical recommendations for the proposed development based on information provided by St William (refer to the Proposed Development drawing in Appendix A). At the time of writing it is understood that the redevelopment will comprise the redevelopment of the former gas works site for a mix of residential and commercial end use.
Whilst information presented in drawing 2 indicates to variable structure heights for the proposed development, no information regarding the proposed structure loadings has been supplied to Ramboll and therefore the following only provides outline geotechnical recommendations.
The recommendations presented should be read in conjunction with the Ramboll Ground Contamination Report (Ref R1620009115_Hertford_ESA_01).

8.1 Foundation Options

8.1.1 Shallow Foundation Solution

Made Ground
From a review of the ground investigation data available, the near surface soils consist of variable Made Ground underlain by the Kempton Park Gravel Member.
Given the variable nature of the existing Made Ground these are not considered suitable for shallow foundations without some form of ground improvement given their potential for high total and differential settlement.
Kempton Park Gravel Member
A shallow foundation solution founding in the underlying medium dense KPGM may be suitable to support the structure (subject to the imposed load). Based on the information obtained during the GEL investigation and the adopted material parameters, the design bearing resistance for granular KPGM is 250 kN/m2. If the occasional layer of cohesive KPGM is encountered, the cohesive soil design bearing resistance is in the order of 230 kN/m2.
The resistance values have been calculated based on the strip shallow foundations bearing at 1.0 mbgl. The analysis is in line with Design Approach 1, Combination 2 partial factors. Serviceability Limit State analysis will need to be checked once imposed foundation size and load has been scoped to ensure the predicted settlement meets the design criteria.
However, as the Made Ground thickness varies significantly across the site (up to 4.65 metres), the depth to a suitable founding stratum may exceed 2.5 metres. Therefore, localised deepening of excavations may be required and may prove to be uneconomic given the volume of material excavated and replaced.
Monitoring data indicates to potentially high groundwater levels, and therefore where granular formation is within the zone of influence of groundwater the calculated bearing capacity should be halved.
Chalk
Recommendations given in CIRIA C574 advise that the lower bound allowable bearing pressure for Grade Dc Structureless Chalk is 225 kN/m. Guidelines for Dc Chalk in CIRIA C574 recommend

FORMER GASWORKS, MARSHGATE DRIVE, HERTFORD	Page 21	Ramboll UK Limited
Ground Investigation Report	Report Ref: 1620009115-RAM-XX-XX-RP-CG-002

that a stress of 225 kN/m2 would approximate to a settlement ratio of, ?/D = 0.2% (where ? is settlement and D is the foundation width). Where Grade Dm Chalk is present at formation, CIRIA C574 recommends that the allowable bearing pressure should be selected only after in situ testing.

8.1.2 Piled Foundation

Given the depth to the structured Chalk mass, if the imposed load exceeds the bearing resistance of the Kempton Park Gravel Member or structureless Chalk, then a piled foundation solution should be utilised to support the proposed structures. The piles would be embedded into the Chalk where the strength of the material would be adequate to support the required loads. Either bored or Continuous Flight Auger (CFA) piles could be used. Driven piles could also be used, however, it should be noted that shaft resistance for driven piles will be reduced due to disturbance of the Chalk as a result of pile driving. Furthermore, the use of driven piles will be dependent upon noise level restrictions imposed by the local authority particularly given the close proximity to existing commercial units and the surrounding residential properties along with any other environmental constraints.
To determine outline pile capacities, shaft friction and end bearing have been estimated using the following methods outlined in CIRIA C574 and CIRIA PR86 Shaft friction of CFA piles in Chalk (2003).
For ultimate shaft friction (?sf) in low density Chalk the following empirical relationship:
?sf = ß.sv´
Where:
ß = effective stress pile friction coefficient for Chalk.
sv´ = average effective vertical stress (kN/m²)
Note: the ß value is dependent on the method of installation and Chalk density.
Geotechnical test results indicate to low density Chalk clasts whilst the in situ SPT N values indicate to a Chalk mass of potentially higher density. Given the variation in results, a conservative lower bound ß value of 0.45 for CFA piles has been adopted when calculating preliminary pile capacities. The ß value may be increased if results of any preliminary pile tests indicate that a higher ß value of 0.8 for CFA piles maybe applicable and therefore higher working capacities achievable. Alternatively, should bored piles be considered then a ß value of 0.8 can be adopted although any contribution to the ultimate shaft resistance from the Made Ground should be omitted.
For ultimate end bearing (qb) resistance in Chalk:
qb = 240.N (kN/m²) for N<30 qb = 200.N (kN/m²) for N>40 Where:
N = SPT N value at the base of the pile.
Using the design ground profiles for the North site and the South site and material parameters presented in Table 7.1, estimations of preliminary pile safe working capacity for CFA piles are presented in Table 8.1 (for the North site) and Table 8.2 (for the South site) based on a governing

factor of safety (FoS) of 2.5 applied to both the ultimate shaft and base resistance (as per CIRIA PR86).

Where groundwater is present there is a risk that Chalk sediment may remain at the base of the pile when constructing bored piles underwater unless the concrete is placed with a tremie. The presence of sediment is likely to increase the settlement of the pile and therefore for bored piles below the water table FoS of 2.5 (shaft) and 5.0 (base) should be applied. For CFA piles below the water table there is no risk of Chalk sediment at the base of the pile.

8.2 Floor Slabs
Generally, the site is underlain by Made Ground of variable nature which in turn is underlain by predominantly medium dense granular gravels from the Kempton Park Gravel Member. Due to the potential for excessive total settlement or damaging differential settlement it is recommended that ground bearing slabs are not utilised unless the cohesive Made Ground or cohesive Kempton Gravels are either removed and replaced with a suitably engineered granular fill, or are subject to ground improvement such as soil stabilisation techniques.
If granular KPG or Chalk is encountered near surface ground bearing floor slabs are likely to perform satisfactorily. In accordance with Interim Technical Note 11 'The Design of Ground Supported Concrete Industrial Floor Slabs', 1998 a modulus of sub-grade reaction (K) for the near surface KPG or Chalk deposits can be taken as 54 MN/m3 or 27 MN/m³ respectively which is considered appropriate for the design of the floor slabs.

8.3 Infilling of Gas Holder Bases
Where infilling of former gas holder bases forms part of the redevelopment, it is recommended that in order to prevent a potential high magnitude of settlement occurring over a long period, any fill material used to infill the gas holder base conforms to a Class 6F1/6F2 as per Table 6/1 of the Specification for Highways Works (SHW) Series 600 Earthworks.

FORMER GASWORKS, MARSHGATE DRIVE, HERTFORD	Page 23	Ramboll UK Limited
Ground Investigation Report	Report Ref: 1620009115-RAM-XX-XX-RP-CG-002

Materials to be placed as part of filling operations should be compacted in accordance with the requirements of the SHW Series 600. The Class 6F1/6F2 material shall be placed by method compaction.
Where piled foundations are adopted then the potential effects of negative skin friction should be considered for any piles constructed through the fill material within the former gas holder.

8.4 Volume Change Potential
Modified Plasticity Index values have been derived for the cohesive layers using the Atterberg Limit tests. The modified PI for cohesive Kempton Park Gravels suggests that the soil has a low volume change potential.
Should spread foundations be deemed a suitable foundation solution then any design should be undertaken in with the NHBC guidance for ?Building near trees? (Part 4, Chapter 4.2 of the NHBC Standards 2016). Heave protection will only be required if new foundations are to be constructed within the zone of influence of existing trees (either to remain or be removed as part of the development).
A comparison of moisture content against liquid limit indicates the clays are not susceptible to desiccation.


8.5 Pavement Design
Ten Plate Loading tests were carried out to determine California Bearing Ratio (CBR) values during the 2020 GEL Investigation (refer to the Exploratory Hole Location Plan in Appendix A). A further five CBR tests were carried out during laboratory testing, using a dynamic compaction with a 2.5kg rammer.
The reported CBR values range from 2% to 19%, with an outlier results of 152%.Values are typically 3% or higher. Based on the in situ CBR test undertaken, a lower bound design CBR value of 3% is recommended. All test results are summarised in Table 8.5.

8.6 Buried Concrete
Chemical testing in accordance with BRE SD1 (reduced suite) were undertaken on select samples of all soils encountered during the 2020 GEL investigation. The characteristic values for each soil type have been derived based on the size of data set and guidance given in BRE Special Digest 1:2005 - Concrete in Aggressive Ground (3rd Edition).
The range of chemical analysis results for pH value, water soluble sulphate content (2:1 water extract as SO4) and total sulphur of the soils are presented in Table 8.6.1. The results will be used to assess the aggressivity of the ground against buried concrete.

The design ACEC class has been derived based on Table C2 Brownfield Site from the BRE Special Digest 1. Due to the presence of granular material underlying the site groundwater has been taken as mobile. The design ACEC class is presented in Table 8.6.2.

1. INTRODUCTION


It is proposed to undertake redevelopment of land at the former Hertford Gasworks site, Hertford. Geotechnical Engineering Limited (GEL) was instructed by Ramboll UK Ltd (the Consultant) acting on behalf of St. William LLP (the Client) to carry out an investigation to determine the ground conditions.

The scope of works and terms and conditions of appointment were specified by the Consultant and GEL correspondence reference T31179 dated 6th March 2020. The investigation was carried out under direction and supervision of the Consultant.

This report describes the investigation and presents the findings.


2. SITE LOCATION AND GEOLOGY


The site is situated at the Former Hertford Gasworks site, off Marshgate Drive, Hertford, Hertfordshire, SG13 7JY and may be located by its National Grid co-ordinates TL 3328 1329. The site is split into two plots of land. The north plot (adjacent to the River Lea) and south plot.

British Geological Survey (BGS) England and Wales (Sheet No. 239 Hertford, 1:50,000, 1978) and the BGS online geology (1:50,000) indicate that both the plots are underlain by Kempton Park Gravel Member comprising sand and gravel with localised lenses of clay. Solid bedrock geology at both plots are shown to comprise Lewes Nodular Chalk Seaford Formation.

Made Ground associated with historical and current site uses is anticipated across both plots.

3. GROUND INVESTIGATION


3.1 Fieldwork


The fieldwork was carried out in general accordance with BS5930:2015 during the period 8th June to 8th July 2020 and comprised twenty-seven boreholes, fourteen windowless sample boreholes, twenty-six trial pit excavations and ten plate loading tests.

The exploratory hole locations were selected by the Consultant and set out by this Company and are shown on Figure. The ground level and co-ordinates at each exploratory hole were established by this Company using GPS techniques.

The contamination status of the site was classified as RED by the Consultant in reference to the British Drilling Association (BDA) guidelines. A decontamination unit was provided and respiratory apparatus and other personal equipment was utilised accordingly.

The boreholes, referenced BH01 to BH05, BH07 to BH15, BH17, BH18, SBH02 to SBH07, SBH08A, SBH09 and SBH10 (Appendix A), were formed using a track-mounted Geotechnical Pioneer Rig. Initially, hardstanding comprising concrete at locations BH10 and BH14 and tarmacadam at locations SBH02 to SBH06 was rotary core drilled to a maximum depth of 0.40m in SBH03. An inspection pit was hand excavated at each borehole location to a maximum depth of 1.30m to check for buried services. Disturbed samples were taken and retained in a combination of plastic tubs, bags and glass jars. The borehole referenced SBH08 was terminated at 1.10m and relocated as SBH08A on account of being unable to progress the inspection pit through cobbles. Heavy duty dynamic sampling techniques were then employed to produce a continuous disturbed sample of 112mm nominal diameter reducing to 97mm when required, as the borehole was advanced. The samples were recovered in semi-rigid plastic liner. Rotary core methods were employed from the base of the inspection pit at BH11 prior to commencing with heavy duty dynamic sampling techniques.

On refusal to dynamic sampling boreholes at locations BH03, BH04, BH09, BH10, BH13 and SBH05 were continued by rotary core drilling techniques utlising a water/polymer flush. A double-tube swivel core barrel with semi-rigid plastic liner was utilised to recover a continuous sample of 107mm (SBH05) and 90mm (BH03, BH04, BH09 and BH13) diameter. Where appropriate, dynamic sampling techniques were carried out to recover dropped core or where rotary core drilling was not suitable.

The dynamic samples and rotary core were extracted horizontally from the sampler and core barrel respectively, the semi-rigid liner was cut to length and caps placed at each end to retain moisture content. All samples and core were retained in sequence in labelled, wooden coreboxes.

Clean drilling techniques were required to protect the underlying formation at locations BH03, BH08, BH09, BH13, BH18 and SBH02. Initially, 200mm and 168mm diameter casing was installed in each borehole and a bentonite seal (between 1.70 to 2.70m thickness) placed within the casing. The bentonite was allowed to cure for an hour prior to sampling through the bentonite with a reduced diameter casing string and advancing the borehole.

The borehole referenced BH06 was formed using hollow stem auger techniques (200mm diameter). Initially, an inspection pit was hand excavated to 1.20m depth to check for buried services. Disturbed samples were taken and retained in a combination of plastic tubs, bags and glass jars.

The boreholes, referenced WS01 to WS05, WS05A, WSO6, SWS01, SWS01A, SWS01B, SWS02 to SWS05 (Appendix A), were formed using a Terrier 2000 rig. Initially, an inspection pit was hand excavated at each borehole location to a maximum depth of 1.20 m to check for buried services. The boreholes referenced SWS01, SWS01A and WS05 were terminated on account of encountering concrete at the base of the inspection pit at SWS01 (0.20m) and SWS01A

(0.20m) and on encountering an unknown service at SWS05 (0.90m). Disturbed samples were taken and retained in a combination of plastic tubs, bags and glass jars. Dynamic sampling techniques were then employed to produce a continuous disturbed sample of 97mm diameter. The samples were recovered in semi-rigid plastic liner.

The samples were extracted horizontally from the sampler, labelled and caps placed each end to retain moisture.

Standard penetration tests (SPT) were carried out in general accordance with BS EN ISO 22476- 3:2005+A1:2011. A split barrel or a solid cone was used depending upon the materials encountered and the split barrel samples retained in airtight jars. The SPT N value was taken as the number of blows to penetrate the 300mm test drive following a 150mm seating drive. Where low penetration was recorded the seating drive was terminated at 25 blows and the test drive completed after a further 50 blows. Detailed SPT results, together with the energy ratio (Er), are presented in Appendix A and summarised as uncorrected N values on the borehole logs.

Boreholes were monitored for groundwater ingress as dynamic sampling proceeded. Upon encountering water, sampling was temporarily stopped to allow the level to stabilise. Water levels were also recorded at the start and finish of each day's work and are presented on the relevant log.

Variable head permeability tests were carried out in BH03, BH09, BH10, BH13 and SBH05 in general accordance with the procedures given in BS EN ISO 22282-2:2012. Falling head tests were carried out by topping up the borehole with clean water. Coefficients of permeability were calculated using the BS EN ISO 22282-2:2012 Hvorslev method and/or the Velocity Graph method. Intake factors have been derived from Hvorslev and are presented along with the results in Appendix A.

On completion standpipe piezometers were installed in BH03, BH09, BH10, BH13, SBH05. The standpipe piezometers consisted of a 19mm ID PVC access tube with a porous tip set in a filter response zone of washed sand. The response zone was sealed above and below with a bentonite plug. The installations were protected at the surface by a lockable, steel borehole helmet cover set in concrete. Installation details are given on the relevant borehole log. Subsequent water level readings are tabulated in Appendix A.

On completion gas/water monitoring standpipes were installed in BH01 to BH07, BH08 (dual installation), BH09 to BH14, BH15 (dual installation), BH17 (dual installation), BH18, SBH02 to SBH07, SBH08A, SBH09, SBH10, WS01 to  WS04, WS05A, WS06, SWS01B and
SWS02 to SWS05. Each installation consisted of a 50mm ID HDPE slotted tube set in a granular filter response zone. The installation was sealed above and below (except at BH02, BH11, BH12, BH15, BH17 SBH03, SBH04, WS04 and SWS01B) with a bentonite plug and accessed via a valve assembly. The installations were protected at the surface by a lockable, galvanised steel borehole helmet cover set in concrete. Installation details are given on the relevant borehole log.

On completion, SBH08, SWS01, SWS01A and SWS05 were backfilled with arisings to surface.


The trial pits, referenced TP01 to TP14, TP16, TP17 and STP01 to STP10 (Appendix A), were formed by a wheeled excavator with a 0.60m wide backactor bucket.

The ground surface at TP03, TP05, TP14, TP16, TP17 and STP01 to STP07 consisted of hardstanding which required breaking out prior to excavation.

Representative disturbed samples were taken and retained in sealed plastic bags and airtight containers to retain moisture content.

Hand vane tests were carried out in suitable cohesive material. The results are presented on the trial pit logs and tabulated in Appendix A.

Photographs of the trial pit profile and spoil heap were taken and are presented separately.


On completion all trial pits were backfilled with arisings compacted in suitable layers by the excavator bucket. The ground surface was left slightly proud to accommodate the future inevitable settlement of the backfill.

Plate loading tests, referenced CBR01 to CBR06 and SCBR07 to SCBR01 to SCBR03, were carried out to determine equivalent California Bearing Ratio (CBR) values. The tests were carried out in general accordance with BS1377: Part 9:1990:4.1 and the equivalent CBR value determined in accordance with HA interim Advice Note 73/06 (2009). A 295mm and 300mm diameter plate was used with load transmitted to the plate by jacking against the underside of an eight tonne wheeled excavator. Sequential loads were applied to produce a penetration range of 0 to 2mm at approximately 0.25-0.50mm intervals. The load determined from a plate penetration of 1.25mm enabled the calculation of the equivalent CBR value. The testing was undertaken by Hixtra Limited and the results are presented in Appendix A.

On completion of fieldwork all samples were brought to this Company's laboratory for testing and storage. During fieldwork samples for chemical analyses were collected and handled under the care of the Consultant.

3.2 Logging


The logging of soils and rocks was carried out by an Engineering Geologist in general accordance with BS5930:2015 and CIRIA C574. A key to the exploratory hole logs is presented in Appendix A.

FRT01 v13 09/06/17 JH	Report Ref: 35880

Detailed descriptions of the core and samples are given in the borehole logs, Appendix A, along with details of sampling, in situ testing, groundwater ingress, installations and relevant comments on drilling techniques.

Suitable core subsamples were selected by the Consultant. The core was carefully logged and prepared prior to preserving the subsample by wrapping in clingfilm/aluminium foil and coating with at least three layers of wax. The sample was further protected by a covering of waxed cheesecloth, labelled and transported horizontally in padded, wooden coreboxes.

Prior to logging, photographs of the core were taken and are presented separately.


The trial pits were logged in situ to a depth of approximately 1.20m and thereafter from the surface. Detailed descriptions are given in the trial pit logs, Appendix A, along with details of sampling and in situ testing, groundwater ingress and relevant comments on stability and excavatability.

3.3 Laboratory Testing


A schedule of laboratory tests was prepared by the Consultant, the following tests being carried out in accordance with BS1377:1990, unless stated otherwise. The number in brackets refers to the test number given in that standard. Given the contaminated nature of certain samples, geotechnical testing was subcontracted to the laboratories of i2 Analytical Limited (Watford). The results are presented in Appendix B.

The natural water content was determined on seventy-seven selected samples in accordance with BS EN ISO 17892-1:2014.

Liquid limit, plastic limit and plasticity index tests [Part 2:4.2 to 4.6 and 5.2 to 5.4] were carried out on thirty-one selected samples. Atterberg line plots have also been presented.

FRT01 v13 09/06/17 JH	Report Ref: 35880

The saturated moisture content [Part 2:3.3] was determined on fifteen selected samples.


The bulk density was determined on seven samples by the immersion in fluid method in accordance with BS EN ISO 17892-2:2014-5.2.

Particle size distributions were determined in accordance with BS EN ISO 17892-4:2016 for forty-one samples by wet sieving [5.2]. The results are presented as grading curves.

The California Bearing Ratio (CBR) test [Part 4:7] was carried out on five recompacted samples. The results are presented as graphs of force against penetration.

Point load index tests were carried out on five selected lengths of core in accordance with IRSM (2007).

The BRE SD1 (2005) reduced suite; water soluble sulphate, total sulphate and total sulphur, together with pH were determined for seventeen samples by Chemtest (Newmarket) using in-house methods.

Four samples were despatched to Chemtest (Newmarket), where loss on ignition was determined to in-house methods.

Logging
The logging of soils and rocks has been carried out in general accordance with BS 5930:2015.

Chalk is logged in general accordance with Lord et al (2002) CIRIA C574. Where possible, dynamic samples in chalk have been logged in accordance with CIRIA C574; descriptions and gradings (if presented) should be treated with caution given the potential for sample disturbance.

For rocks the term fracture has been used to identify a mechanical break within the core. Where possible incipient and drilling induced fractures have been excluded from the assessment of fracture state. Where doubt exists, a note has been made in the descriptions. All fractures are considered to be continuous unless otherwise reported.

Made Ground is readily identifiable when, within the material make up, man made constituents are evident. Where Made Ground appears to be reworked natural material the differentiation between in situ natural deposits and Made Ground is much more difficult to ascertain. The interpretation of Made Ground within the logs should therefore be treated with caution.

The descriptors "topsoil" and "tarmacadam" are used as generic terms and do not imply conformation to any particular standard or composition. Rootlets are defined as being less than 2mm in diameter, roots are defined as in excess of 2mm diameter.

General Comments
The process of drilling and sampling will inevitably lead to disturbance, mixing or loss of material in some soil and rocks.

Indicated water levels are those recorded during the process of drilling or excavating exploratory holes and may not represent standing water levels.

All depths are measured along the axis of the borehole and are related to ground level at the point of entry. All inclinations are measured normal to the axis of the core.

Where provided, the stratigraphic names/geological rock units are for guidance only and may not be wholly accurate.

REMARKS
Expressions come from Hvorlsev.
BS EN ISO 22282-2:2012 recommends the use of intake factors given above for the Hvorlsev method variable head test. BS EN ISO 22282-2:2012 reports equation D as suitable for the Velocity method variable head test where 1.2 < L/D < 10.
BS EN ISO 22282-2:2012 refers to a simpler version of Equation D for L/D > 10, however Equation D will still apply for L/D > 10. Equation D may be used for tests using piezometer tips.
Cases A and B tend to measure the mean permeability of the soil; C and D the horizontal permeability; E and F the vertical permeability. Where the horizontal permeability is much greater than the vertical, all tests tend to measure the former.
